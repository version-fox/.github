## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to here!

# Introduction

**`vfox` is a cross-platform version manager(similar to `nvm`, `fvm`, `sdkman`, `asdf-vm`, etc.), extendable via plugins**. It allows you to quickly install
and switch between different environment you need via the command line.

## Why use vfox?

- **cross-platform support** (**Windows**, Linux, macOS)
- **consistent commands** to manage all your languages
- supports **different versions for different projects, different shells, and globally**.
- simple **plugin system** to add support for your runtime of choice
- **automatically switches** runtime versions as you traverse your project
- support for existing config files `.node-version`, `.nvmrc`, `.sdkmanrc` for easy migration
- shell completion available for common shells (Bash, ZSH, Powershell, Clink)
- **it's faster than `asdf-vm`, and offers more simple commands and genuine cross-platform unification.**
